# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing portfolio website for Manav Dhindsa, a Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience, into an immersive, interactive showcase that demonstrates advanced web development skills through cutting-edge 3D visualizations, mathematical art, and WebAssembly performance demos. The enhanced portfolio will serve as both a personal showcase and a technical demonstration of modern web capabilities, featuring his extensive experience across startups in PropTech, LegalTech, and test automation spaces. The portfolio will showcase five major interactive sections: 3D Interactive Resume Timeline, Mathematical Art Gallery, Code Architecture Visualizer, WASM Performance Demos, and Shader Art Playground, all built upon his current Next.js, TypeScript, and Three.js foundation while maintaining GitHub Pages hosting constraints (under 1GB total size).
